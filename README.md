# Product Entry Case Study

In this project I wanted to use Etl class to handle the extract, transform and load operations to divide up the work.

I also used a Database class to instantiate the database connection and a Product dataclass to be saved into the database.

Extract and load parts of the Etl are relatively simple compared to the transform part. In the extract method I am only reading the data from the given file. In the load method I am writing the data into the database.

## Transfroming the Data

In the transform method I first converted the data to a dictionary using an external library called xmltodict to access each tag more easily. 

arrange_product_data method, called in transform method, iterates over each product found in the newly created dictionary and creates a Product object for each of them. Ä±t gets the required fields from the given data and modifies the keys or values when necessary to match the output format. 
For the productDetails part I iterate over each product detail item and change the key or value when necessary. 

For the description tag I decided to use another external library called BeautifulSoup to parse the html text stored in the description. I noticed that there is a pattern where each of the keys are written inside a "strong" tag. However, not all strong tags are keys. I decided to use the colons written after the potential keys to split the text, and changed the key names to match the example output. For the sample size value I assumed that it would allways be written inside strong tags and wouldn't contain a colon, since it was the case for all of the products given in the xml file.

## Product 

I created the Product dataclass to bette organize the structure of the data to be put into the database. In this project I didn't used any functionality of the Product dataclass except from calculating some of the values from the given data.

## Writing to Database

I created an upsert_many method inside the Database class, which calls the update_one method for each item. In the update_one method I set upsert parameter to True to avoid any multiple inserts for the same data and I add createdAt and updatedAt fields for the data in the update parameter. 


#### Assumptions about the Data

The color field would be separated by commas if there were multiple colors were listed in one product. 
The isDiscounted value is false when the discounted_price and price values are the same, and true if otherwise.
The status value is "Active" if quantity is greater than zero, and "Inactive" otherwise.
The price_unit value is "USD" by default and it would be given inside a ProductDetail tag.
